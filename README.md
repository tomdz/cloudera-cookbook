# Cloudera cookbook

Installs and configures [Cloudera's](http://www.cloudera.com/) Hadoop + Hive


# Status

The cookbook is on a fairly good shape now, it was used to stand up a production cluster. New version is coming which will DRY up the codebase.

# Requirements

* Chef 10
* Redhat, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu

# Attributes

## Version attributes

* `node[:hadoop][:version]` - Cloudera "sub version", cloudera provides rpms with version info in the rpm name. Default `0.20` 
* `node[:hadoop][:release]` - Cloudera release. 3u1, 3u2, etc. Used to derive url path for repo file, if you provide something different make sure the cloudera repos ([5](http://archive.cloudera.com/redhat/cdh/) & [6](http://archive.cloudera.com/redhat/6/x86_64/cdh/)) still supports that version. Default `3u3`

## Configuration attributes

* `node[:hadoop][:conf_dir]` - The hadoop config dir used inside /etc/hadoop and referenced via the alternatives system. Default `conf.chef`
* `node[:hadoop][:namenode_port]` - Port for namenode service. Default `54310`
* `node[:hadoop][:jobtracker_port]` - Port for jobtracker service. Default `54311`

##Rack-aware attributes

* `node[:hadoop][:rackaware][:datacenter]` - What datacenter is this hadoop node in. Default `default`
* `node[:hadoop][:rackaware][:rack]` - What rack is this hadoop node in. Default `rack0`

## Alternate install location attributes
* `node[:hadoop][:yum_repo_url]` - Provide an alternate yum install localtion. If you change this attribute `node[:hadoop][:release]` will not be used to derive the yum_repo_url and you are expected to provide a path to a working repo for the `node[:hadoop][:version]` used. Default `nil`
* ~~`node[:hadoop][:yum_repo_key_url]` - Provide an alternate yum repo key location. Default `nil`~~ Currently not implemented!
